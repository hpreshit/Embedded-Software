This project involves writing a binary logger application for a microcontroller that uses the prior work with the UART and Circular Buffers. A logger enables one to report data to a PC, this helps to interpret what is happening with the embedded system. This application is extended to use DMA as a mechanism to off-load transmitting of the data. The execution time of various operations is documented using a profiler and the systick counter. In the last part of this project, this code is leveraged to communicate with the Nordic Wireless transceiver via the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).

The objectives of this project are:
    1) Use DMA to perform data memory movements.
    2) Enhance the circular buffer code to be more efficient and robust.
    3) Develop a binary ogger o end ata o  UART.
    4) Profile the library functions to determine execution time.
    5) Create a SPI driver to interface with a Nordic Wireless transceiver.
