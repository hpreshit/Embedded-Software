This project consists of deleloping embedded C-programming code, integrate the code with the build system and gain experience with Git version Control.



The objectives of this project are:
    1) Incorporate a C-program application into Make and GCC build system.
    2) Write C-program functions that manipulate memory.
    3) Execute and test the application by simulating it on the host machine.
    4) Use git Version control to create a repository to version control code.
