This project involves writing a data processing application for the microcontroller. This application utilizes a circular buffer data structure, configure a microcontroller and the use of a few peripherals including: clock systems, General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) and a Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit (UART) module. Aditionaaly, a unit test code was developed using the Cmocka unit test framework.

The objectives of this projects are:
  1) Design a circular buffer data structure.
  2) Write firmware for a UART peripheral to transmit and receive data.
  3) Use interrupts to handle I/O requests to process an input byte sequence.
